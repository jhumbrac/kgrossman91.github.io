		<h1>Design 1 Project</h1>
		<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
		<p><a href="https://www.uber.com" target="_blank">Uber</a> and <a href="https://www.harrys.com" target="_blank">Harrys</a></p>
		<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
		<p>Both sites use plenty of visual elements, call to actions and an extremely easy way to navigate the webpage.</p>
		<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
		<p>Both websites use a lot of very high resolution images to display the product. Additionally both websites have their main products on the home page. It's hard to find true differences between the sites but Harry's has less going on and uses more white page.</p>
