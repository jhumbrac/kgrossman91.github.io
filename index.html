		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
			I'm a MBA student, living in Atlanta. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I have always wanted to learn how to code and actually create something from scratch.
		</p>
		<strong>My Mission</strong>
		</p>
		As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a product manager with any technology firm because I like to work in a fast-paced and start-up culture.
		</p>
		<strong>My Experience</strong>
		<p>
		This is how I've evolved professionally:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Founder</strong>, Campus Foodz</li><br>
			<li><strong>Co-Founder</strong>, Digital Images Group</li><br>
			<li><strong>Marketing Director</strong>, Let It Fly Energy</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Education</strong></p>
		<p>MBA at Emory and Finance Major at UCF</p>
